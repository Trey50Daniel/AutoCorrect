OVERVIEW OF THE PROGRAM
-------------------------------------

* This program is a GUI created to 
showcase a simplified version of a
search engine. 

* The GUI allows users
to enter a search word that will
populate a text file upon pressing
the "Search" button. 

* The program also reads from the 
text file and tries to give the user
the closest word to what they 
are typing.

* There is an Auto-Complete field that displays the closest match to the user's search.
* The way that the Auto-Complete is generated is by finding the most characters that match in the list.

## Installation
To run the program, double click on the program once it is downloaded on your computer. If that does not bring up the GUI, then run the program from the command line.
## Usage
Run the program and search different words to test the functionality of the Auto-Complete function.
